But interceptors can\n   add whatever they want to `:coeffects` - perhaps the event handler needs\n   some information from localstore, or a random number, or access to\n   a DataScript connection.\n\n   Equally, some interceptors in the chain will have `:after` fn\n   which can process the side effects accumulated into `:effects`\n   including but, not limited to, updates to app-db.\n\n   Through both stages (before and after), `context` contains a `:queue`\n   of interceptors yet to be processed, and a `:stack` of interceptors\n   already done.  In advanced cases, these values can be modified by the\n   functions through which the context is threaded."],"~$assoc-effect",["^ ","^F",null,"^G",["^ ","^H","/Users/sansarip/Dev/nw-calculator/resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",38,"^J",7,"^K",38,"^L",19,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["^P","^Q","^1:"]]]]]],"^:","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v1v1v2.re-frame.interceptor/assoc-effect","^H","resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^L",19,"^W",["^N",[["^P","^Q","^1:"]]],"^Z",null,"^X",["^N",[null,null]],"^J",1,"^T",false,"^I",38,"^12",["^9",["^1<","^11"]],"^K",38,"^V",3,"^13",true,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["^P","^Q","^1:"]]]]]],"~$enqueue",["^ ","^F",null,"^G",["^ ","^H","/Users/sansarip/Dev/nw-calculator/resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",111,"^J",7,"^K",111,"^L",14,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["^P","^1Q"]]]]]],"^:","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v1v1v2.re-frame.interceptor/enqueue","^H","resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^L",14,"^W",["^N",[["^P","^1Q"]]],"^Z",null,"^X",["^N",[null,null]],"^J",1,"^T",false,"^I",111,"^12",["^9",["^1<","^11"]],"^K",111,"^V",2,"^13",true,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["^P","^1Q"]]]]]],"~$mandatory-interceptor-keys",["^ ","^:","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v1v1v2.re-frame.interceptor/mandatory-interceptor-keys","^H","resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",9,"^J",1,"^K",9,"^L",32,"^G",["^ ","^H","/Users/sansarip/Dev/nw-calculator/resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",9,"^J",6,"^K",9,"^L",32],"^10","~$cljs.core/ISet"],"~$interceptor?",["^ ","^F",null,"^G",["^ ","^H","/Users/sansarip/Dev/nw-calculator/resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",11,"^J",7,"^K",11,"^L",19,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["~$m"]]]]]],"^:","~$day8.re-frame-10x.inlined-deps.re-frame.v1v1v2.re-frame.interceptor/interceptor?","^H","resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^L",19,"^W",["^N",[["~$m"]]],"^Z",null,"^X",["^N",[null,null]],"^J",1,"^T",false,"^I",11,"^12","~$boolean","^K",11,"^V",1,"^13",true,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["~$m"]]]]]],"~$change-direction",["^ ","^F",null,"^G",["^ ","^H","/Users/sansarip/Dev/nw-calculator/resources/public/js/compiled/dev/day8/re_frame_10x/inlined_deps/re_frame/v1v1v2/re_frame/interceptor.cljc","^I",132,"^J",8,"^K",132,"^L",24,"^15",true,"^M",["^N",["^O",["^N",[["^P"]]]]],"^17","Called on completion of `:before` processing, this function prepares/modifies\n   `context` for the backwards sweep of processing in which an interceptor\n   chain's `:after` fns are called.\n\n  At this point in processing, the `:queue` is empty and `:stack` holds all\n  the previously run interceptors.
