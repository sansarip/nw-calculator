  performance optimization, so it doesn't do a whole huge map just to
  find out that it could not possibly have fit on one line.  So, this
  returns a sequence of style-vecs, where the indentation for the
  stuff inside of the pairs is already there, but the separators of
  the style-vecs (including indentation and commas) is done by the
  caller of fzprint-map-two-up. Always returns a sequence of vector pairs:

  If you want a style vec instead, call remove-hangflow on the return 
  from fzprint-map-two-up.  This will use one-line?, but not check to see
  that it actually fits.  If you care about that, then you should check the
