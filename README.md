# New World Crafting Calculator (ðŸ‘· WIP)

Web app for calculating item crafting ingredients in [New World](https://www.newworld.com/en-us/). 

View it at [newworldcraft.io](https://newworldcraft.io).

Data scraped from [nwdb.info](nwdb.info) ðŸ™‡

PRs are welcome! You can find me for collaboration [here on Discord](https://discord.gg/FCqzwycR23).

## Current State of the App

For simplicity's sake, all item data is in the [items.json file](https://github.com/sansarip/nw-calculator/blob/main/resources/public/data/items.json). 
If you notice an issue, you can make a PR to add/edit the data in the aforementioned JSON file. 
If your changes include adding/editing an image url of an item, then you must also put a corresponding 128x128 image in the [images directory](https://github.com/sansarip/nw-calculator/tree/main/resources/public/images).

## Dev

Get a no-strings-attached dev environment with [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/sansarip/nw-calculator) ðŸ’¥ (it may take a while to build initially) _or_ read the info below to set up your dev environment locally.

### Prerequisites <a name="prereqs"></a>

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

### Web App

Run the web application (figwheel-main) server with the following command:

`lein fig:dev`

After some time, you should be able to browse to http://localhost:9500 to 
view the main app and http://localhost:9500/devcards.html to view the devcards.

### Scraper

The scraper graciously pulls data from [nwdb.info](nwdb.info) in a single-threaded, throttled fashion.

`lein scrape`

## Prod

If you wish to create a release, you'll need the same [prerequites as Dev](#prereqs) installed. You'll want to also make sure you have the following tools installed:

* [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

To compile the Prod JS, run `lein fig:prod`.

Or, you can just run `make release` which will compile Prod JS, 
overwrite `build/` (this is where the site's content is built from), 
bump the version, prompt for a CHANGELOG update, and commit the release.
